Near Earth Objects Detector
This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React that uses the NASA Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API to detect and display information about near-Earth objects (NEOs). The application provides a user-friendly interface to visualize data on asteroids and comets that come close to Earth.

Features
Real-time Data: Fetches the latest data on near-Earth objects from NASA's NeoWs API.
Detailed Information: Displays comprehensive information about each detected NEO, including size, risk, magnitude, and distance from Earth.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate layout to quickly view and understand NEO data.
Responsive Design: Ensures usability across various devices and screen sizes.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js installed on your machine
npm (Node Package Manager) installed
A NASA API key (you can obtain one from NASA API Portal)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/near-earth-objects-detector.git
cd near-earth-objects-detector
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your NASA API key:

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
Usage
To run the application locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
